      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our baby is now 3 years old. The name TenSketch means “Perfect Arts”. Ten (10) has the entire world in it. The binary ‘1’ and ‘0’ is the foundation for digital calculation. Ten (10) in a rating scale is the maximum and means perfect. The Sketch is purely devoted to Arts and designing. We brand this way, with meaning and concept.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
